## Settings

Fill out the form with the data required on the `Settings Page`. Find a reference below:

- `OWNER:` The username or organization name that owns the repository.
- `REPO:` The name of the repository.
- `WORKFLOW_ID:` You can either write the full name of your .yml file, ie. "manual-trigger-workflow.yml" or the ID of the workflow that you want to trigger. You can find the ID of a workflow by going to the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub, clicking on the name of the workflow, and looking at the URL of the page. The ID is the number that appears after the last forward slash in the URL.
- `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN:` A personal access token (PAT) with the repo scope. You can create a PAT by going to "Settings" > "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens" in your GitHub account.
- `REF:` The name of your repository's main branch.
  Important: At the moment the plugin is able to create a webhook for a workflow_dispatch trigger without inputs. This feature is planned for later versions.
